Introduction: Kali Linux: A Linux distribution with Debian roots called Kali Linux is made for penetration testing and digital forensics. Offensive Security oversees and provides maintenance for it.Kali Linux offers 600 penetration-testing applications, including Armitage, Nmap, Wireshark, John the Ripper, sqlmap, Aircrack-ing, Burp, and OWASP ZAP. It was created by Offensive Security employees Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns through the rewriting of BackTrack, a Linux distribution they had previously used for information security testing and which was based on Knoppix. The Hindu deity Kali served as the name's inspiration.

Honeypot: Honeypotss are network-attached systems used by hackers to identify and research tactics and types of attacks. Large businesses and cybersecurity-related organisations are the main users, but crooks may use them to hoodwink researchers and disseminate false information.

PenTBox: PenTBox is a security suite that can be used in penetration testing engagements to perform a variety of activities.Specifically these activities include from cracking hashes,DNS enumeration and stress testing to HTTP directory brute force.


Also since we are using mac OS we do not need to install install Kali Linux because mac is already a UNIX-based system (similar to Linux).
If you are using windows you will have to install Kali-Linux.

Follow these steps to install PenTbox
Open Terminal (Command + Space, type Terminal, and press Enter).

 Type :- ruby -v
If Ruby is installed, youâ€™ll see a version number like Ruby 3.x.x.
If not, install it using:

brew install ruby
